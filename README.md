Language identification

As the quality of internet services around the world has gotten much better, more and more people are making and using content. This has led to an increase in the number of people who want to watch media in languages they don't know or prefer. 
So, there is a growing need for real-time and fine-grained content analysis services, such as identifying the language, transcribing the content, and analyzing it. Accurate and fine-grained detection of spoken language is a necessary first step for everything that comes after.
Current methods for detecting spoken languages may not be very good at predicting the final language, need a lot of training data, or only work with a small number of languages.
In this work, we build CNN + LSTM, CNN + Bidirectional-GRU and CNN + Bidirectional-GRU + Attention for language identification.
